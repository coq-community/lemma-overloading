synopsis: "Libraries demonstrating design patterns for programming and proving with canonical structures in Coq"
description: """
This project contains Hoare Type Theory libraries which
demonstrate a series of design patterns for programming
with canonical structures that enable one to carefully
and predictably coax Coq's type inference engine into triggering
the execution of user-supplied algorithms during unification, and
illustrates these patterns through several realistic examples drawn
from Hoare Type Theory. The project also contains typeclass-based
re-implementations for comparison."""
